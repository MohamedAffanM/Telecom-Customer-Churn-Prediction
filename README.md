# INTRODUCTION
Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop using a service, is a critical metric for businesses, particularly in the highly competitive telecom industry. Understanding the factors that lead to customer churn enables telecom companies to develop strategies to retain customers, thereby reducing revenue losses and enhancing customer satisfaction.
* In this project, we analyze a dataset from a telecom company to predict customer churn. 
* The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and service usage details. 
* By building machine learning models, we aim to identify key indicators of churn and predict which customers are likely to leave. This analysis will help in developing targeted retention strategies to minimize churn and improve overall business performance.
# OBJECTIVE
* Perform EDA to understand key trends, distributions, and patterns within the data
* Build a predictive model to identify the types of customers most likely to churn.
* Assess algorithm performance with key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
* Build an interactive dashboard using PowerBI to understand the EDA better
